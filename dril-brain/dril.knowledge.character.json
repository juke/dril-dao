      "## WELCOME TO RIDE \n\nRide is an NFT platform that enables creators to make fungible, high-supply NFTs. The platform is designed for meme creators to be able to distribute their work to a huge number of collectors rather than a niche group. The idea behind Ride is simple: some things like memes are more fun when more people own them. **CREATORS** Memes are the precious commodities of the Internet. Ride allows creators to turn memes into commodity form, or currencies, whichever descriptor you prefer. The current trend of memecoins has been to invent a funny word to describe the meme, but the meme itself is lost in the process. The coin is a cheap simulacrum of the meme. Ride offers a straightforward solution to this problem: you can make NFTs that are extremely high in supply and fungible so that the NFT functions as a coin would. You can view the NFT in your wallet to appreciate its aesthetic qualities or use it as if it were a coin. NFTs used in this way can not only perform the same functions as traditional ERC20s (social coordination, moneyness, governance). They preserve the memetic experience and thereby provide a qualitatively richer experience than a traditional coin. Ride is a numismatic experiment to turn collectibles into currency. **RECENT SECTION** After you've minted your NFT, it is put into the Recent Section. It will stay here until it has graduated to the Featured Section. If your NFT does not graduate after 10 days, it is delisted from the Recent Section. Users can still buy and sell your NFT by going to your collection's page. _Presale_ Your NFT is now in presale mode. 45% of the supply is available for sale in ETH or a Ride NFT itself. Each buyer pays the same price per unit while it is in presale. This design is meant to mitigate predatory trading practices like sniping new mints. Users can burn their NFTs to recoup their buy-in if they no longer want to participate in the presale. The Ride protocol takes a 0.5% fee on buys and sells for NFTs paired with an ERC20. After $42,000 in value has been recouped in the presale, the NFT graduates to the Featured Section. The content creator will now be able to earn royalties. **PRESALE** NFTs on Ride are traded using MAGIC as the base pair or Ride NFTs themselves. In other words, you can sell an NFT in exchange for another NFT. This option would be most beneficial for derivative meme makers or someone just looking to have some fun. NFTs can be bought as well as sold in the presale mode. 45% of the total supply is available for presale. If you no \n\n\nlonger believe in the meme, you are free to sell off. The price of the NFT will remain the same during the presale mode. _Featured_ Once an NFT has made it to the Featured section, the NFT is traded through a liquidity pool with burnt liquidity. Future versions of Ride are likely to include a system by which an NFT can always be sold for the presale price. However, for v1, we have built out a robust rewards system to mitigate aggressive early selling in the Featured mode. _Fees_ Ride takes a 0.5% fee on NFTs bought and sold on the platform. While in presale, these fees are recouped by the protocol. For featured NFTs, the content creator earns 0.3% while the protocol fee is reduced to 0.2%. **FEATURED SECTION** 45% of the NFTs were distributed in the presale. After the NFT has moved to Featured, another 45% is used along with the presale proceeds to create the liquidity pool that supports ongoing buying and selling. The final 10% is sent to a vault to be used as platform rewards. _Royalties_ Content creators earn 0.3% royalties on trading of their featured collections. The protocol fee is reduced to 0.2%. The admin has the ability to change the royalty recipient and royalty amount. If you use artwork that is not yours or cannot be considered meaningful change to an existing meme, your royalty will be reduced to 0% or reassigned. The NFT creator will not receive platform rewards for these collections either. _Rewards_ Creators whose NFTs make it to the Featured section are eligible for platform rewards. See Packs for more information. _Liquidity_ LP tokens are sent to the zero address, thereby burning them. In future versions, we may introduce alternate forms of the presale, but the underlying AMM -a fork of TreasureDAO's Magicswap v2 protocol -is unlikely to require new adjustments. **Rewards** Ride does not have a token at this time. For v1, users will be able to earn rewards called Packs which can be redeemed for the best performing NFTs on the site. _Packs_ Users can earn pack drops by buying NFTs after they have reached the Featured section or having created Featured NFTs. There are no rewards for buying or making a Recent collection. \n\n\nThe first pack drop will occur a few weeks into the launch of v1. This will allow people to begin creating new content. A pack can be opened at any time. The user will receive a random assortment of NFTs that are claimable for rewards. If there are 1,000 packs in circulation, then a pack contains 0.1% of the entire claimable rewards. You are free to sell your pack to another user or hold onto it until later if you believe the vault contents will be greater at a later date. _Other Ways to Earn_ For the first version, Ride users can earn pack drops in three ways: \n\n- Creating a collection that graduates to Featured and performs well \n\n- Buying Featured NFTs and not selling them or transferring them \n\n- Reflinks _Dynamic Rewards_ Collections that perform extremely poorly after a few days will be pruned from the claimable rewards. The only contents that packs will open are NFTs that have performed consistently well over a reasonable time-frame. The Ride rewards system as a whole is based on the idea that if nothing is performing well on the platform, then no rewards should exist for users. If the NFTs are performing extremely well and generating royalties for creators, then users should be rewarded. This incentive structure allows rewards to dynamically adjust to the platform's own performance, eliminating the need for a new asset (a token) that will continue to exist even if the platform never achieves adoption. _Criteria_ We are keeping the criteria for earning drops intentionally vague. Calculations will be performed offchain. The primary criterion is buying NFTs from the Featured section and not selling them or transferring them to another address. Ride rewards are geared towards HODLers with the calculations factoring in a reasonable amount of selling by every user. We will discount users who are seen to be buying early then selling soon after it reaches Featured. If you engage in this behavior repeatedly, then your total Featured buys will be discounted. _Future Utility_ None at this time. Future utility will be announced without warning and is not guaranteed. **REFLINKS** You can refer other people to the Ride platform. Doing so will increase your rewards. Visit the reflinks section of the platform to get started. _Reward Multiplier_ \n\n\nThe reflink will provide us information on what your referred user did while on the platform. The higher their rewards (meaning they engaged in pro-social behavior), the higher your rewards for referring them. Your rewards will not be impacted negatively through reflinks. In other words, if you referred 1,000 people to the site and none owned rewards, then this does not decrease your rewards. You simply will not earn any rewards for these referrals. \n\n\n"
